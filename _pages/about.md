I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at Penn State University, advised by Dr. [Rui Zhang](https://ryanzhumich.github.io/). My research interests span two areas:

- **Data annotation in practice.** I study how real-world annotation processes diverge from expectations, including annotator bias and guideline inconsistencies, and how to build more robust NLP models despite these gaps.
- **LLM inference.** I work on making large language model serving faster and more efficient, with recent focus on speculative decoding.

Previously, I obtained my M.S. in Information Management from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Dr. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html), and my B.S. in Computer Science from Changsha University of Science & Technology, advised by Dr. [Daojian Zeng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c1wQ9_kAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
