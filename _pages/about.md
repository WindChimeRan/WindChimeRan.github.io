I am a first-year master's student at UIUC. My research interest is relation extraction in natural language processing and I'm currently a member of [BLENDER Lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/), advised by Professor Heng Ji. Prior to joining BLENDER at UIUC, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science at CSUST, where I was supervised by Dr. Zeng.
