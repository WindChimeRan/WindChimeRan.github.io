I am a first-year CS PhD student at Penn State University advised by Dr. [Rui Zhang](https://ryanzhumich.github.io/). My research interests lie in natural language processing. My research aims to build a universal framework that can **extract and deduce logical information from heterogeneous textual data**.

- Information Extraction
- Executable Semantic Parsing
- Indirect Supervision
- Education x NLP

<!-- its improvement or its applications in computational social science and learning science.  -->

<!-- I'm currently a member of [BLENDER Lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/) and working on relation extraction. The projects I’ve worked on include fake news detection, news attribute verification, knowledge graph construction, event detection, etc. -->


<!-- Due to my severe health condition, I have worked from home for over 3 years since 2017 so I’m pretty good at it. If you need help with working from home, chat with me, maybe I can enlighten you.  -->


<!-- After a long-term treatment, I have finally recovered and resumed my life. I’m now looking for an **internship** or a **full-time job** in machine learning, deep learning or similar fields. In the long run, I’m looking to join a **Ph.D. program** in NLP or related fields. If you need someone to collaborate and think I can be a good fit, send me an email and I’d be happy to work with you! -->

<!-- Fun facts about me: I like road trips and have travelled to 5 states the last summer. I’m color blind but I paint, sometimes. I love cats (but have none) and mechanical keyboards (and have 3)! -->



<!-- , advised by Professor Heng Ji. Prior to joining BLENDER at UIUC, I received my bachelor’s degree in computer science at CSUST, where I was supervised by Dr. Zeng. -->
