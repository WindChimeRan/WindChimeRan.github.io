I am a first-year master's student at UIUC. My research interest is relation extraction in natural language processing and I'm currently a member of [BLENDER Lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/), advising by Professor Heng Ji. Prior to joining BLENDER at UIUC, I graduated from CSUST, supervised by Dr. Zeng.
