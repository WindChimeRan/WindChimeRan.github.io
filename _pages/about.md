I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at Penn State University, advised by Dr. [Rui Zhang](https://ryanzhumich.github.io/). My research interests lie in natural language processing, specifically in making better use of **available** and **unavailable** data to develop better models. I am particularly interested in exploring the following questions:

- With millions of data, millions of annotators, is it exhaustive enough to train a strong specialized model?
- What strategies can be employed to unify diverse labeled datasets for training universal models across multiple tasks?
- When combining heterogeneous datasets, how can we maintain and verify data quality and consistency?

I'm also interested in the applications of LLMs in Computer Science Education (CSEdu), and using CSEdu theory to develop better CodeLLMs datasets.

Previously, I obtained my M.S. in Information Management from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Dr. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html), and my B.S. in Computer Science from Changsha University of Science & Technology, advised by Dr. Daojian Zeng.
